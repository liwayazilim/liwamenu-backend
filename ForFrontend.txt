üì¢ Important Backend Update: Authentication & Email Flows

We‚Äôve made major improvements to our authentication and user management backend. Please review the following changes, as they will affect how the frontend interacts with the API:

---

1. Email Verification & Password Reset

- Tokens:
  - The backend now uses ASP.NET Core Identity‚Äôs built-in token system for email verification and password reset.
  - The tokens sent in emails are now secure strings (not short codes). They may look long and contain special characters.

- Frontend Actions:
  - When a user receives a verification or reset email, the link will include `email` and `token` as query parameters.
  - The frontend should extract these and send them to the backend‚Äôs verification or password reset endpoints.
  - If you display a ‚Äúcode‚Äù input, users must paste the full token from the email (not just a 4-digit code).

2. Endpoints & Payloads

- Verify Email:
  - Endpoint: POST /api/users/verify-email (or as documented)
  - Payload:
    {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "verificationCode": "the-long-token-from-email"
    }

- Reset Password:
  - Endpoint: POST /api/users/reset-password (or as documented)
  - Payload:
    {
      "emailOrPhone": "user@example.com",
      "code": "the-long-token-from-email",
      "newPassword": "newpassword123"
    }

3. No More IsVerified

- The backend now uses the EmailConfirmed property (from Identity) to track if a user‚Äôs email is verified.
- If you were checking IsVerified or expecting a ‚Äúnot verified‚Äù error, now look for ‚ÄúUser email is not verified‚Äù in error messages.

---

4. User Experience

- The verification and reset tokens are now longer and more secure.
- If you want to provide a ‚Äúclick to verify‚Äù or ‚Äúclick to reset‚Äù experience, use the link in the email and parse the query params.
